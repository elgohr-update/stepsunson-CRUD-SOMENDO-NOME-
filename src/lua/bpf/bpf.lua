-- LuaJIT to BPF bytecode compiler.
--
-- The code generation phase is currently one-pass and produces:
-- * Compiled code in BPF bytecode format (https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/filter.txt)
-- * Variables with liveness analysis and other meta (spill information, compile-time value)
--
-- The code generator optimises as much as possible in single pass:
-- * Fold compile-time expressions and constant propagation
-- * Basic control flow analysis with dead code elimination (based on compile-time expressions
