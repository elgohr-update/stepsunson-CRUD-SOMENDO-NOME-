.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool counts swapins by process, to show which process is affected by
swapping (if swap devices are in use). This can explain a significant source
of application latency, if it has began swapping due to memory pressure on
the system.

This works by tracing the swap_readpage() kernel function
using dynamic instrumentation. This tool may need maintenance to keep working
if that function changes in later kernels.

Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
CONFIG_BPF and BCC.
