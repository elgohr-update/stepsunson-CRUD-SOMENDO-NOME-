.TH sslsniff 8  "2016-08-16" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
sslsniff \- Print data passed to OpenSSL, GnuTLS or NSS. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sslsniff [-h] [-p PID] [-u UID] [-x] [-c COMM] [-o] [-g] [-n] [-d]
.B [--hexdump] [--max-buffer-size SIZE] [-l] [--handshake]
.B [--extra-lib EXTRA_LIB]
.SH DESCRIPTION
sslsniff prints data sent to write/send and read/recv functions of
OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS, allowing us to read plain text content before
encryption (when writing) and after decryption (when reading).

This works reading the second parameter of both functions (*buf).

Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
CONFIG_BPF and bcc.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-h
Print usage message.
.TP
\-p PID
Trace only functions in this process PID.
.TP
\-u UID
Trace only calls made by this UID.
.TP
\-x
Show extra fields: UID and TID.
.TP
\-c COMM
Show only processes that match this COMM exactly.
.TP
\-o, \-\-no-openssl
Do not trace OpenSSL functions.
.TP
\-g, \-\-no-gnutls
Do not trace GnuTLS functions.
.TP
\-n, \-\-no-nss
Do not trace GnuTLS functions.
.TP
\-\-hexdump
Show data as hexdump instead of trying to decode it as UTF-8
.TP
\-\-max-buffer-size SIZE
Sets maximum buffer size of intercepted data. Longer values would be truncated.
Default value is 8 Kib, maximum possible value is a bit less than 32 Kib.
.TP
\-l, \-\-latency
Show function latency in ms.
.TP
\--handshake
Show handshake latency, enabled only if latency option is on.
.TP
\--extra-lib EXTRA_LIB
Consist type of the library and library path separated by colon. Supported
library types are: openssl, gnutls, nss. Can be specified multiple times.
.SH EXAMPLES
