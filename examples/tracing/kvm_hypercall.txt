Demonstrations of kvm_hypercall.py, showing eBPF/bcc based hypercall analysis

This example demonstrates how we can statefully save static tracepoint
events based on conditions being met for other events with which they are
associated. Here, we wish to record kvm_exit and kvm_entry events which are
linked to the kvm_hypercall event. We are interested in kvm_exit with exit
reason as VMCALL (18). This may be useful to analyze latency caused by a
hypercall itself.

To test this, while the python script is run, induce a hypercall from a
guest based on the following example:
