# BPF Compiler Collection (BCC)

BCC is a toolkit for creating efficient kernel tracing and manipulation
programs, and includes several useful tools and examples. It makes use of
extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filters), formally known as eBPF, a new feature
that was first added to Linux 3.15. Much of what BCC uses requires Linux 4.1
and above.

eBPF was [described by](https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/4/14/232) Ingo MolnÃ¡r as:

> One of the more interesting features in this cycle is the ability to attach eBPF programs (user-defined, sandboxed bytecode executed by the kernel) to kprobes. This allows user-defined instrumentation on a live kernel image that can never crash, hang or interfere with the kernel negatively.

BCC makes BPF programs easier to write, with kernel instrumentation in C
(and includes a C wrapper around LLVM), and front-ends in Python and lua.
It is suited for many tasks, including performance analysis and network
traffic control.

This example traces a disk I/O kernel function, and populates an in-kernel
power-of-2 histogram of the I/O size. For efficiency, only the histogram
summary is returned to user-level.

       2 -> 3        : 0        |                                      |

       8 -> 15       : 0        |                                      |
      16 -> 31       : 0        |                                      |
      32 -> 63       : 0        |                                      |
      64 -> 127      : 1        |                                      |
     128 -> 255      : 800      |**************************************|
```

The above output shows a bimodal distribution, where the largest mode of
800 I/O was between 128 and 255 Kbytes in size.
