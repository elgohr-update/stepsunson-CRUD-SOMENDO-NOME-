Demonstrations of virtiostat, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


This program traces virtio devices to analyze the IO operations and
throughput. For example, guest side mounts a 9p fs, and we can't get
io statistics by `iostat` command any more. In this scenario, we can
only get statistics from VIRTIO layer instead of block layer.

Example
#./virtiostat -T
