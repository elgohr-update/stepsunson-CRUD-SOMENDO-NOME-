Demonstrations of stackcount, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


This program traces functions and frequency counts them with their entire
stack trace, summarized in-kernel for efficiency. For example, counting
stack traces that led to the submit_bio() kernel function, which creates
block device I/O:

# ./stackcount submit_bio
