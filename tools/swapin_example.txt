Demonstrations of swapin, the Linux BCC/eBPF version.


This tool counts swapins by process, to show which process is affected by
swapping. For example:

# swapin.py 
Counting swap ins. Ctrl-C to end.
13:36:58
COMM             PID    COUNT

13:36:59
COMM             PID    COUNT
gnome-shell      2239   12410

13:37:00
COMM             PID    COUNT
chrome           4536   14635

13:37:01
COMM             PID    COUNT
gnome-shell      2239   14
cron             1180   23

13:37:02
COMM             PID    COUNT
gnome-shell      2239   2496
[...]

While tracing, this showed that PID 2239 (gnome-shell) and PID 4536 (chrome)
suffered over ten thousand swapins.
