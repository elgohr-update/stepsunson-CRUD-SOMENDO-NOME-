Demonstrations of tcptracer, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


This tool traces the kernel function performing TCP connections (eg, via a
connect() or accept() syscalls) and closing them (explicitly or if the process
dies). Some example output (IP addresses are fake):

```
# ./tcptracer
Tracing TCP established connections. Ctrl-C to end.
