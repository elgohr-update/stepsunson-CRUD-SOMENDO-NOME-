# funclatency   Time functions and print latency as a histogram.
#               For Linux, uses BCC, eBPF.
#
# USAGE: funclatency [-h] [-p PID] [-i INTERVAL] [-T] [-u] [-m] [-F] [-r] [-v]
#                    pattern
#
# Run "funclatency -h" for full usage.
#
# The pattern is a string with optional '*' wildcards, similar to file
# globbing. If you'd prefer to use regular expressions, use the -r option.
#
# Without the '-l' option, only the innermost calls will be recorded.
# Use '-l LEVEL' to record the outermost n levels of nested/recursive functions.
