Demonstrations of netqtop.


netqtop traces the kernel functions performing packet transmit (xmit_one) 
and packet receive (__netif_receive_skb_core) on data link layer. The tool 
not only traces every packet via a specified network interface, but also accounts 
the PPS, BPS and average size of packets as well as packet amounts (categorized by 
size range) on sending and receiving direction respectively. Results are printed 
as tables, which can be used to understand traffic load allocation on each queue 
of interested network interface to see if it is balanced. And the overall performance 
is provided in the buttom.

For example, suppose you want to know current traffic on lo, and print result 
every second:
# ./netqtop.py -n lo -i 1
