Demonstration of readahead, the Linux eBPF/bcc version

Read-ahead mechanism is used by operation sytems to optimize sequential operations
by reading ahead some pages to avoid more expensive filesystem operations. This tool
shows the performance of the read-ahead caching on the system under a given load to
investigate any caching issues. It shows a count for unused pages in the cache and
also prints a histogram showing how long they have remianed there.

Usage Scenario
==============

Consider that you are developing a React Native application which performs aggressive
reads while re-encoding a video in local-storage. Usually such an app would be multi-
layered and have transitional library dependencies. The actual read may be performed
by some unknown native library which may or may not be using hints to the OS, such as
madvise(p, LEN, MADV_SEQUENTIAL). If high IOPS is observed in such an app, running
readahead may pin the issue much faster in this case as the developer digs deeper
into what may be causing this.

An example where such an issue can surface is: https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/issues/691

# readahead -d 30
