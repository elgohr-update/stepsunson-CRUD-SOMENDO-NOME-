Demonstrations of criticalstat: Find long atomic critical sections in the kernel.

criticalstat traces and reports occurrences of atomic critical sections in the
kernel with useful stacktraces showing the origin of them. Such critical
sections frequently occur due to use of spinlocks, or if interrupts or
preemption were explicitly disabled by a driver. IRQ routines in Linux are also
executed with interrupts disabled. There are many reasons. Such
