Demonstrations of argdist.


argdist probes functions you specify and collects parameter values into a
histogram or a frequency count. This can be used to understand the distribution
of values a certain parameter takes, filter and print interesting parameters
without attaching a debugger, and obtain general execution statistics on
various functions.

For example, suppose you want to find what allocation sizes are common in
your application:

# ./argdist -p 2420 -c -C 'p:c:malloc(size_t size):size_t:size'
[01:42:29]
p:c:malloc(size_t size):size_t:size
        COUNT      EVENT
[01:42:30]
p:c:malloc(size_t size):size_t:size
        COUNT      EVENT
[01:42:31]
p:c:malloc(size_t size):size_t:size
        COUNT      EVENT
        1          size = 16
[01:42:32]
p:c:malloc(size_t size):size_t:size
        COUNT      EVENT
        2          size = 16
[01:42:33]
p:c:malloc(size_t size):size_t:size
        COUNT      EVENT
        3          size = 16
[01:42:34]
p:c:malloc(size_t size):size_t:size
        COUNT      EVENT
        4          size = 16
^C

It seems that the application is allocating blocks of size 16. The COUNT
column contains the number of occurrences of a particular event, and the
EVENT column describes the event. In this case, the "size" parameter was 
probed and its value was 16, repeatedly.

Now, suppose you wanted a histogram of buffer sizes passed to th
