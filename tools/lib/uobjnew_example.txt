Demonstrations of uobjnew.


uobjnew summarizes new object allocation events and prints out statistics on
which object type has been allocated frequently, and how many bytes of that
type have been allocated. This helps diagnose common allocation paths, which
can in turn cause heavy garbage collection.

For example, trace Ruby object allocations when running some simple commands
in irb (the Ruby REPL):

# ./uobjnew -l ruby 27245
Tracing allocations in process 27245 (language: ruby)... Ctrl-C to quit.
