Demonstrations of tcpconnect, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


This tool traces the kernel function performing active TCP connections
(eg, via a connect() syscall; accept() are passive connections). Some example
output (IP addresses changed to protect the innocent):

# ./tcpconnect
PID    COMM         IP SADDR            DADDR            DPORT
1479   telnet       4  127.0.0.1        127.0.0.1        23
1469   curl         4  10.201.219.236   54.245.105.25    80
1469   curl         4  10.201.219.236   54.67.101.145    80
1991   telnet       6  ::1              ::1              23
2015   ssh          6  fe80::2000:bff:fe82:3ac fe80::2000:bff:fe82:3ac 22

This output shows four connections, one from a "telnet" process, two from
"curl", and one from "ssh". The output details shows the IP version, source
address, destination address, and destination port. This traces attempted
connections: these may have failed.

The overhead of this tool should be negligi
