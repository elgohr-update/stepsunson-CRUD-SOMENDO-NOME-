Demonstrations of wakeuptime, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


This program measures when threads block, and shows the stack traces for the
threads that performed the wakeup, along with the process names of the waker
and target processes, and the total blocked time. This blocked time is measured
from when a thread blocks, to when the wakeup signal is sent. Note that this
time excludes some run queue latency from the target thread, which may not
immediately execute if it needs to wait its turn on-CPU. All the data shown,
stack traces, process names, and times, are summarized in-kernel using an eBPF
map for efficiency.

This tool is intended to be used after offcputime, which shows the directly
