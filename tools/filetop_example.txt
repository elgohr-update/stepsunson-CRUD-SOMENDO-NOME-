Demonstrations of filetop, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


filetop shows reads and writes by file, with process details. For example:

# ./filetop -C
Tracing... Output every 1 secs. Hit Ctrl-C to end

This shows various files read and written during a Linux kernel build. By
default the output is sorted by the total read size in Kbytes (R_Kb). Sorting
order can be changed via -s option. This is instrumenting at the VFS interface,
so this is reads and writes that may return entirely from the file system cache
(page cache).

While not printed, the average read and write size can be calculated by
dividing R_Kb by READS, and the same for writes.

The "T" column indicates the type of the file: "R" for regular files, "S" for
sockets, and "O" for other (including pipes). By default only regular files are
shown; use the -a option to show all file types.

This script works by tracing the vfs_read() and vfs_write() functions using
kernel dynamic tracing, which instruments explicit read and write calls. If
files are read or written using another means (eg, via mmap()), then they
will not be visible using this tool.

This should be useful for file system workload characterization when analyzing
the performance of applications.

Note that tracing VFS level reads and writes can be a frequent activity, and
this tool can begin to cost measurable overhead at high I/O rates.


A -C option will stop clearing the screen, and -r with a number will restrict
the output to that many rows (20 by default). For example, not clearing
the screen and showing the top 5 only:

# ./filetop -Cr 5
Tracing... Output every 1 secs. Hit Ctrl-C to end
